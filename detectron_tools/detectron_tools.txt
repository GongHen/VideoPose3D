To split the video you plan on using try to use ffmpeg.

Splitting command:  ffmpeg -i out_cutted.mp4 -r 25 splitted_scating/output%04d.png
-i = input (out_cutted.mp4 --> https://github.com/tobiascz/VideoPose3D/blob/master/InTheWildData/out_cutted.mp4)
-r = fps
arg = output directory

I downloaded the video named it ice.mp4 and called the ffmpeg command like this. This will take a while because the video has many frames.

Now you can run detectron. Replace the infer_simple provided in this folder with the infer_simple from detectron (or just rename it). Run the infer_simple and the exported poses will be stored at your location (change 'pathToSave')

Now you created everything you need as Input for VideoPose3D!
